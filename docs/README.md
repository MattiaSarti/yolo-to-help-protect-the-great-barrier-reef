    Kaggle Competition:<br>

Unfortunately, I discovered and enrolled this wonderful competition too late, with only a minimal fraction of the whole competition time left.<br>
But I decided to take the opportunity of working with such a visually beautiful dataset to learn by implementing a simplified version of YOLOv3 myself from scratch, having fun exploring the dataset, defining the model, training and evaluating it while knowing in advance it would not have had the capacity of more advanced models and there was not time for an extensive hyperparameter tuning.<br>


## Repository Structure

Looking at the root directory of the repository:
    - the folder ***/kaggle*** contains [the command used to download the dataset](...), [the command used to create the submitted notebook assembling all the different source files](...) and [the final submitted notebook](...)
    - the folder ***/source*** contains all and only the source code compressed in the above-mentioned final submitted notebook, but split into different files for the sake of maintainability
    - the folder ***/docs/pictures*** is just a folder that contains small memories that give a taste of the competition, since the dataset can not be publicly shared
    - the file ***/docs/TODO.md*** is a collection of TODOs annotated and checked by myself suring the competition solution development to note down and remember key thoughts of mine
    - the file ***/docs/README.md*** is what you are reading now
