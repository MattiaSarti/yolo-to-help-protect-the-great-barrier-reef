Unfortunately, I discovered and enrolled this wonderful competition too late, with only a minimal fraction of the whole competition time left.<br>
But I decided to take the opportunity of working with such a visually beautiful dataset to learn by implementing a simplified version of YOLOv3 myself from scratch, having fun exploring the dataset, defining the model, training and evaluating it while knowing in advance it would not have had the capacity of more advanced models and there was not time for an extensive hyperparameter tuning.<br>
